Changelog:
1. Deleted Scored by, Members, and Favorites so scoring will not be biased. However, episodes is still set to rank_feature and some low scoring anime have high number of episodes. Boosting the score will give better results. Please see sample code on how to boost rank_feature.
2. Updated episodes for some anime since rank_feature won't allow for NA.
3. Updated index.
4. Included 1563 instances of data.

Sample code for rank_feature boosting:
